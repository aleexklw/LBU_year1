# Year 1 programming recap - Python and Javascript projects

This repo contains contains a collection of programming projects and exercises complete throughout my first year college course in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.
I am using it to show my understanding of both JavaScript and Pyhon as well as a foundational guide for future projects throughout my studies or even career. Note that the code is rewritten in certain locations for clarification.
